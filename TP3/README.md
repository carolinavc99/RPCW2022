I am running this on a Windows machine, on the VSCode terminal. If you have a different setup, details may vary, but the execution should be the same.

# How to run the program

`cd TP3`

`json-server .\db.json`

`node .\music_server.js`

Then access `localhost:4000/` on your browser. The default port is 4000 and is indicated on the terminal when you run the program, but it can be changed in `music_server.js` on the "port" variable.

As you explore the pages, the terminal will also show the the ones delivered by the fileserver. All the html pages are created by the program as they are needed.
